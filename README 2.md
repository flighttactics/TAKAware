#  TAK Aware

TAK Aware is a lightweight [TAK](https://www.tak.gov) client for Apple Devices. It is designed to sit at the intersection of modern iOS design while also allowing those familiar with ATAK to quickly be operational with similar look at feel.

Below is a portion of the roadmap being tracked. If something isn't working or you don't see something on the list below, please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/flighttactics/TAKAware/issues) to let us know about it (if it isn't already being tracked there) and we'll route it either to this project or to [SwiftTAK](https://github.com/flighttactics/SwiftTAK) depending on where the issue/feature is.

If you are interested in integrating this into your own product or want a custom iOS/Android/etc TAK app, plugins or features, let us know by contacting opensource at flighttactics dot com or visiting [Flight Tactics](https://www.flighttactics.com)
